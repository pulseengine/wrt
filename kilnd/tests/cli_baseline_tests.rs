//! PulseEngine CLI baseline conformance for the `kilnd` binary (issue #486).
//!
//! The baseline every varve-layer tool must meet:
//!   1. `--version` / `-V` print `<binary-name> <semver>` and exit 0.
//!   2. `--help` exits 0; an unknown flag exits 2 with usage on stderr.
//!
//! These are pinned as tests because kiln *executes other tools' artifacts*
//! (witness' `--harness` cross-check runs modules under kilnd), so "which
//! runtime produced this run" has to be answerable from the binary itself.
//! Asserting the reported version equals `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` — which is the
//! workspace version the release tag is cut from — is the in-repo half of the
//! "assert `--version` == the tag" release check #486 asks for.
