/// A synchronization primitive which can be written to only once.
///
/// This type is analogous to `std::sync::OnceLock` or
/// `once_cell::sync::OnceCell`.
///
/// # Safety
/// This implementation uses `UnsafeCell` to store the actual data `T` once
/// initialized. The `WrtMutex<bool>` (`initialized_lock`) is used to ensure
/// that the initialization logic runs at most once. After initialization, the
/// data is considered immutable and references can be safely given out.

}

/// # Safety
/// This implementation of `Send` for `WrtOnce<T>` is safe if `T` is `Send`,
/// because access to the inner `UnsafeCell<MaybeUninit<T>>` data is
/// synchronized. During initialization, the `mutex` ensures exclusive access.
/// After initialization (`initialized` is true), the data is treated as
/// immutable and accessed via shared references (`&T`), which is safe. The
/// `AtomicBool` (`initialized`) is also `Send`.

/// This implementation of `Sync` for `WrtOnce<T>` is safe if `T` is `Send +

/// threads during initialization. `Sync` is required because after
/// initialization, `&T` can be shared across threads. Access to the inner
/// `UnsafeCell<MaybeUninit<T>>` data is synchronized: during initialization,
/// the `mutex` ensures exclusive access. After initialization (`initialized` is
/// true), the data is accessed via `&T`. If `T` is `Sync`, then `&T` is `Send`,
