Architecture Decision Log
=======================

.. warning::
   **Development Status**: This section is under construction. Architecture Decision Records 
   (ADRs) are being documented as design decisions are made during development.

Overview
========

This document maintains a chronological log of significant architectural decisions made during 
PulseEngine development. Each decision includes context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

Decision Process
================

Architecture decisions follow this process:

1. **Problem Identification**: Clear statement of the architectural challenge
2. **Options Analysis**: Evaluation of alternative approaches
3. **Decision**: Selected approach with justification
4. **Consequences**: Expected impacts and trade-offs

Detailed Records
================

ARCH_001: Multi-Environment Support Strategy
--------------------------------------------

**Context**: PulseEngine needs to run in diverse environments from development machines to embedded systems.

**Decision**: Implement four distinct environment configurations:

- **std**: Full standard library (development, testing)
- **no_std + alloc**: Heap allocation without std (embedded Linux, QNX)
- **no_std**: Only static allocation (safety-critical RTOS)
- **bare-metal**: Minimal runtime (custom hardware)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single configuration with runtime detection
- Separate crates for each environment
- Macro-based conditional compilation only

**Rationale**: Feature flags provide compile-time optimization while maintaining single codebase.

**Status**: ✅ Accepted

ARCH_002: Safety-Critical Memory Management
-------------------------------------------

**Context**: Safety-critical applications require deterministic memory behavior.

**Decision**: Use bounded collections and pre-allocated memory pools for safety-critical configurations.

**Implementation**:
- BoundedVec instead of Vec for ASIL-rated code
- Static memory allocation during initialization
- Compile-time capacity limits

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom allocator with deterministic behavior
- Memory pools with runtime allocation
- Standard library with runtime checks

**Rationale**: Compile-time bounds checking provides highest safety assurance.

**Status**: ✅ Accepted

ARCH_003: Component Model Architecture
--------------------------------------

**Context**: WebAssembly Component Model requires complex parsing and linking.

**Decision**: Separate component parsing from execution engine for better modularity.

**Design**:
- wrt-component: Component parsing and type checking
- wrt-runtime: Core execution engine
- wrt-host: Host function integration

**Status**: 🚧 Under Review - Implementation in progress

ARCH_004: Platform Abstraction Strategy
----------------------------------------

**Context**: Different platforms (QNX, Zephyr, bare-metal) have varying capabilities.

**Decision**: Use trait-based platform abstraction layer.

**Implementation**:
- Platform trait for core operations
- Conditional compilation for platform-specific code
- Unified API across platforms

**Status**: ✅ Accepted

Future Decisions
================

Planned architectural decisions:

- **ARCH_005**: WebAssembly instruction execution strategy
- **ARCH_006**: Integration testing approach
- **ARCH_007**: Performance optimization strategy
- **ARCH_008**: Security boundary implementation
