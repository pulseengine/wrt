   The testing and verification architecture includes:
   
   1. WAST test runner for specification conformance
   2. Safety tests for verifying safety mechanisms
   3. Fuzzing infrastructure for identifying edge cases
   4. Code coverage measurement
   5. Quality assurance processes
   6. Component model testing
   7. Memory safety verification tests

.. impl:: WAST Test Runner
   :id: IMPL_009
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_022, REQ_WASM_001
   
   The WAST test runner provides comprehensive WebAssembly specification compliance testing:
   
   1. **Complete Directive Support**: All WAST directive types (assert_return, assert_trap, assert_invalid, etc.)
   2. **Multi-Environment Compatibility**: Support for std, no_std+alloc, and no_std environments
   3. **Intelligent Test Categorization**: Automatic grouping by test type for optimal execution
   4. **Integration with Test Registry**: Built on wrt-test-registry framework
   5. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel execution for independent tests
   6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Intelligent error classification and reporting
   7. **Resource Limit Testing**: Support for assert_exhaustion and resource constraints
   8. **Module Registry**: Multi-module linking tests with register directive support
   
   For detailed documentation, see :doc:`../developer/testing/wasm_test_suite`.
